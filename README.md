# README for MLParticlePhysics Project

## Overview
The `MLParticlePhysics` project is an experimental venture applying machine learning techniques to experimental particle physics, with a focus on particle identification using collision data. This project is currently in a developmental stage and serves primarily as a documentation of my ongoing work in this domain.

## Features
- **Data Source**: Uses data generated by the Pythia8 particle collision simulator, a cornerstone in particle physics research.
- **Data Conversion**: Transforms data from Pythia8's .root format to numpy (.npy) format, facilitating data handling and analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Incorporates RandomForestClassifier and XGBoost for particle identification, leveraging their strengths in handling complex datasets.
- **Data Stratification**: Utilizes StratifiedShuffleSplit to ensure balanced class representation, essential for unbiased model training.
- **Accuracy Assessment**: Employs accuracy scores to gauge the performance of the models.
- **Visualization**: Includes matplotlib scripts for 3D scatter plot visualizations, offering insights into the multidimensional nature of the dataset.

## Current Status
- **In Development**: The project is in the process of development and refinement.
- **Documentation Purpose**: Currently, the project is not intended for practical use. Its primary purpose is to document the ongoing work and methodologies being explored.

## Technical Description
- **Data Preparation**: Starts with the preparation of collision data, mapping various parameters like pseudo rapidity, momentum, and charge to particle codes.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Features RandomForest and XGBoost classifiers, evaluated for their accuracy in particle type prediction.
- **Visualization**: Provides scripts for 3D scatter plots to visualize data distributions and inter-parameter relationships.

## Contact for Original Data
- **Pythia8 Code & data sets**: For access to the original Pythia8 code used to generate the collision data and the originating .root data files, please contact me on email [email](mailto:mustafa_elboghdady@aucegypt.edu).

## Note
This project is a work-in-progress and is primarily aimed at documenting my exploration and learning process in applying machine learning techniques to particle physics. It is currently not ready for professional or practical application.
